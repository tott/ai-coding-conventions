# ai-coding-conventions
A set of coding conventions for a variety of projects that can be used to inform AI assisted coding

Mainly for use with aider https://aider.chat/docs/usage/conventions.html but might be helpful in other frameworks too.

This is an opinionated set of guidelines that work for me. Please feel encouraged to fork this repository and adjust to your need.

Explain how to use with aider

If possible explain how to use with other IDE such as cursor
